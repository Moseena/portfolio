        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm  Moseena a tech enthusiast with a strong foundation in IT and a growing passion for front-end web development. 
            I recently completed an apprenticeship at <strong>Dell Technologies</strong>, where I gained hands-on experience 
            in troubleshooting, system maintenance, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver innovative solutions. 
            This experience taught me the importance of problem-solving, attention to detail, and working in a fast-paced environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my time at Dell, I developed a keen interest in creating user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces. 
            This inspired me to pursue a career in <strong>front-end web development</strong>. I have since been learning and 
            working with technologies like <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React</strong> to build responsive and dynamic websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am now eager to transition into a front-end web developer role, where I can combine my technical expertise 
            from Dell with my creativity and passion for building engaging web experiences. I am constantly learning new tools 
            and frameworks to stay updated in this ever-evolving field, and I am excited to contribute to innovative projects 
            that make a difference.
        </p>
